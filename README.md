# ransomware
This is a small ransomware script written in python.<br>

Okay, so, voldemort.py encrypts the files located in same directory whereas harry.py decrypts them.<br>

<h3>How to use:</h3>
<h2> Keep files to be encrypted in files_ folder</h2>
<h4>To encrypt</h4>
<ol>
  <li> run voldemort.py in terminal using <code> python .\voldemort.py </code> </li>
  <li> you'll be asked if you're sure. type "y" (without the quotes)
  <br>
    you'll get a confirmation message.<br>
    and... that's it
</ol>

<h4>To decrypt</h4>
<ol>
  <li> run harry.py in terminal using <code> python .\harry.py </code> </li><br>
  <li> Enter password: "coffee" </li><br>
  you'll get a conformation message.<br>
    and... that's it
</ol>

Password: "coffee" (it'll ask for password if harry.py is run)<br>

<h3>Requirements:</h3>
<ul>
  <li> install cryptography package (from cryptography.fernet import Fernet)
  <li> also os is also imported fyi
</ul>

<h3>To do:</h3>
<ul>
  <li> <s> I might try changing the code to decrypt files from a different folder but for now the files are as is.</s>
</ul>

<br>

The above objective was achieved<br>

Finally, comments are overly described. So, have fun :)
