# ransomware
This is a small ransomware script written in python.

Okay, so, voldemort.py encrypts the files located in same directory whereas harry.py decrypts them.

Password: "coffee" (it'll ask for password if harry.py is run)

Requirements:
-> install cryptography package (from cryptography.fernet import Fernet)
-> also os is also imported fyi

To do: <br>
-> I might try changing the code to decrypt files from a different folder but for now the files are as is.

Please help, if you can, to achieve the above objective.
