# ransomware
This is a small ransomware script written in python.<br>

Okay, so, voldemort.py encrypts the files located in same directory whereas harry.py decrypts them.<br>

Password: "coffee" (it'll ask for password if harry.py is run)<br>

<h3>Requirements:</h3>
<ul>
  <li> install cryptography package (from cryptography.fernet import Fernet)
  <li> also os is also imported fyi
</ul>

<h3>To do:</h3>
<ul>
  <li> I might try changing the code to decrypt files from a different folder but for now the files are as is.
</ul>

<br>

Please help, if you can, to achieve the above objective.
